## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of what these tools are designed for.

Here is a detailed description of how `hardhat-deploy-templates` (or similar smart contract deployment frameworks) integrates with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.

### The Short Answer

**`hardhat-deploy-templates` does not directly integrate with CEXs like Binance or Coinbase for automated trading and portfolio management.** It is a framework for **developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts** on **blockchain networks** (like Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum), not for interacting with centralized exchange order books.

The confusion arises from mixing two distinct domains:
1.  **On-Chain (DeFi):** The world of smart contracts, blockchains, and decentralized protocols. This is where `hardhat-deploy-templates` operates.
2.  **Off-Chain (CeFi):** The world of traditional, centralized exchanges with their own private databases and order books.

To achieve automated trading and portfolio management across both domains, you need a bridge between the on-chain and off-chain worlds.
